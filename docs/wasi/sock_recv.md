Receive a message from a socket

@param sock: i32 - The file descriptor of the socket to receive from
@param ri_data: i32 - A list of scatter/gather vectors to which the received data will be stored
@param ri_data_len: i32 - The length of the scatter/gather vector list
@param ri_flags: i32 - Message flags
@param ro_data_len: i32 - A pointer to store the number of bytes read
@param ro_flags: i32 - A pointer to store the message flags
@return error: i32

The `sock_recv()` function is used to receive a message from a socket. It is similar to the `recv` function in POSIX, but it also supports reading the data into multiple buffers in the manner of `readv`.

The function receives data from the socket and stores it in the provided scatter/gather vectors. The number of bytes stored in `ri_data` and the message flags are returned.

### Notes

- The `sock_recv()` function receives a message from a socket and stores it in the provided scatter/gather vectors.
- The function supports reading the data into multiple buffers.
- The `ri_data` parameter represents a list of scatter/gather vectors, where each vector contains a buffer and its length.
- The `ri_data_len` parameter specifies the length of the scatter/gather vector list.
- The received data is stored in the buffers specified by the scatter/gather vectors.
- The number of bytes read from the socket is stored in `ro_data_len`.
- The message flags are stored in `ro_flags`.
- The specific behavior of the `sock_recv()` function may vary depending on the runtime environment and underlying networking implementation.
