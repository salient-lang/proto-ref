The `sock_accept()` function is used to accept a new incoming connection on a listening socket. It is similar to the `accept` function in POSIX.

When a connection is accepted, a new socket is created and returned. This new socket represents the communication channel with the client.

### Notes

- The `sock_accept()` function accepts a new incoming connection on a listening socket.
- The function blocks until a connection request is received.
- Upon successful acceptance of a connection, a new socket is created to handle communication with the client.
- The file descriptor flags specified by `fd_flags` control the behavior of the new socket.
- The address of the remote client, including the IP address and port number, is written to the memory location pointed to by `ro_addr`.
- The specific behavior of the `sock_accept()` function may vary depending on the runtime environment and underlying networking implementation.
